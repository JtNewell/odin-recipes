            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Mix peanut butter, sugar, and egg together in a bowl using an 
                    electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Roll mixture into small 
                    balls and arrange on a baking sheet; flatten each with a fork, 
                    making a criss-cross pattern.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Cool cookies on the 
                    baking sheet for 2 minutes before moving to a plate.</li>
