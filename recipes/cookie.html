            <h3>Steps!</h3>
        </p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar 
                    and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and 
                    egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients 
                    until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a 
                    wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared 
                    cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the 
                    edges are lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few 
                    minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
