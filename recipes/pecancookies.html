            <h3>Steps!</h3>
        </p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie 
                    sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; whisk until 
                    well combined.</li>
                <li>Place butter and brown sugar in a large bowl and beat with an 
                    electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg 
                    whites and vanilla extract, and beat for 1 more minute. Gradually 
                    add flour mixture to the bowl and mix until completely combined. 
                    Fold in pecans and toffee bits until all ingredients are well 
                    incorporated.</li>
                <li>Scoop dough into heaping tablespoon-sized balls with a spoon or 
                    cookie scoop. Place dough balls about 2 inches apart on the 
                    prepared baking sheet and flatten just slightly with the palm of 
                    your hand.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and lightly 
                        browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cookies cool on the baking 
                        sheet for 1 minute, then transfer to a wire rack to cool 
                        completely.</li>
            </ol>
